realy made 2 different versions of the survivor walk + crouch walk for some reason, if the animations look janky for whatever reason when the animations are played then you could try and use these:

Survivor Walk - https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/9398497835/Survivor-Walk-WITH-TOOLS
Survivor Crouch Walk - https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/9398500064/Crouch-Walk-WITH-TOOLS
